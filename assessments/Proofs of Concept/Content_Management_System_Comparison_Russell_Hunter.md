# Similarities

Both WordPress and Jekyll are open source, blogging options for creating a site. Both are popular, one with the general public and the other with the github community as it is the engine github runs on. Both of them provide free options and the default site name has a portion dedicated to the CMS involved. The two CMS's have templates that will allow you to produce much more professional presentation on your site.

# Differences

The two sites differ in many ways as well. One of the key concepts of Jekyll is that it is a static site generator and does not use databases. WordPress's content creation is more direct and is a little more user friendly where as writing content for Jekyll is a little more seperate and written in markdown outside of the main pages. WordPress everything is right in formt of you on the user interface.

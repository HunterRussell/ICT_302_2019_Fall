# What Changes Did You Make?

When we made the first round of changes, I made changes to the "About Me" page of the website's text. I made sure that everyone was aware of the fact that Ryle High School is the superior of the Boone County Schools. I also tried to change a few of the font sizes but I was in the assets code rather than in the templates which I would later come to realise was where a lot of the presentation was taking place.


# What Did You Learn?

I learned that you are not meant to add content to the template page but that you did anyway. I also found where the home page was because I was looking for it both times we messed around with the site.

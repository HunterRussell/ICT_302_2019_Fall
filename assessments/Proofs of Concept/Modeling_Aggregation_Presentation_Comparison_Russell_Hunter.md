# Similarities

All three sites have a homepage with a serial content structure. Beto's site is just one big scrolling thank you letter now and is very clearly serial. The Homepage of both BBC America and Mercedes-Benz are designed with top to bottom linked images that go to other parts of the site and are also serial.

# Differences

The rest of the sites are different. In this case, Beto's site is only serial and has no other pages that can be reached organically. The site for BBC America is very categorically designed. It could also possibly be described as Network. It is a news site, therefore they designed it in a manner that would fit the function their site is going for. Mercedes-Benz site is designed as a hierarchy because they are trying to sell things and their is a top page that leads down to the rest.

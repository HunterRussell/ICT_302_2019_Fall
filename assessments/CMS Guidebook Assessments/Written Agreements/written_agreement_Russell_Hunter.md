# What Is Being Done?

I will do my best to keep the administrators group on track. Specifically, I will make sure that we have an idea what we need to do on group work days and attempt to give the group specific tasks for in-class work

# When Is It Being Done?

I will begin this immediately and it will continue throughout the entirety of the semester. I will spend some free time throughout the week to get an idea for what we need to get done in class that friday.

# How Will It Be Evaluated?

I believe it should be evaluated by whether I have a plan for our group work days every week, as well as, keeping us on track for the project and getting what we need to get done, completed.

# Who Will Evaluate It?

I think Eric Carpenter is the  best fit for who should evaluate my work for the semester. Eric and I work together every group work day and I think he would definitely be able to decide whether I'm getting done what I am agreeing to.

# Changes

I made Eric my evaluator because of the recent changes we've decided on as a group for how these will work. I also made it more specific to what makes sense based on the way things have been going so far.

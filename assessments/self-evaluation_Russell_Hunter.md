2. Fill out the sections below by responding to each prompt in blockquote (the text beginning with `>`) in each section. Unlike previous assessments, **please keep the prompts in this document after you are done**.
3. Delete this instructions section and replace it with your name.

# Course Objectives

Throughout the semester, the following “I can” statements have served as guiding objectives for this course. Now that we're at the end of the semester, you should feel comfortable making each statement about yourself and be able to back up that statement with your performance on course activities and assessments. Because of the important role that the CMS Guidebook has played in our course, and because of the unstructured nature of this assignment, please concentrate in particular on your contributions to that project as you evaluate yourself according to course objectives.

## I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.

I can identify and define key concepts that are involved in content management. Items like open-source and content modeling are two of the prominent ones that come to mind in this moment. Open-source in it's esssence is allowing anyone to use your software and make their own changes to it if they do so choose. Content can be displayed in many ways. Content modeling is the formal means of organizing content. Content models are made up of content types.

6 out of 8 - I did not maintain a strong memory of all of the defintions of the key concepts

## I can manage content using established workflows.

There were several times that I, as the de facto leader of the adminastrators, had to establish workflows and design how things would be done. The first time I had to create a workflow for the groups was when I got the google doc info from the editors and had the other administrators create ClickUp tasks for the editors. Once we got the tasks created for the editors to go off of, I set a due date which gave the developers an idea of when they would be able to get to work on the pages. The way I planned to create a workflow or the other groups was to set them up in an almost timeline orientation so that once the editors worte pages the developers would know and be able to do their work on them. Internally, within the administrators group specifically, I established workflows that allowed us to get things done in a timely manner and still gave those who had not been to class or had done much work an opportunity to do some work if they did so choose and backup plans in case they did not.

8 out of 8 - I was the de facto leader of the administrators and was in charge of creating workflows. The way I setup the workflow for the other groups was one of my proudest moments as a part of this content team.

## I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.

I was able to implement the use of ClickUp for tasks, so that those in other groups would know when they needed to have things done and when other groups get things done. We were really not using the functionality of ClickUp very well to start so I went ahead and got the other groups to create master lists of tasks that I could get into ClickUp. ClickUp calendars are another item that I made sure to implement. I had all of the class members signup for the calendars so that all of the ClickUp tasks would be placed into their calendars. 

8 out of 8 - I used technology as a means of implementing the workflows that I organized for the groups. The use of this tech was crucial to keeping everything organized and on schedule.

## I can find and use resources for self-directed learning

I took several deep dives in to RSS Feeds and several other things from class that have practical uses in my free time. I asked you about RSS feeds and several other items in terms of podcasting and other things and this led to me exploring it much much deeper on my own. Another thing was a deep dive I took into CMSs involved in podcast hosting and website creation for a podcast. I also took some time to look into Toggl to keep track of my time and I really thought it was a good way of making sure that you are not wasting all of your time throughout the day.

8 out of 8 - I took several opportunities to do some self-directed learning based on what we did in class. I used wuite a bit of free time looking into several of the minor things we talked about like Toggl

## I can describe and compare content management systems.

In the CMS comparison assignment, I was able to do a good job of comparing Jekyll and WordPress. I only compared those two however and got a 1.5/2 on the assignment. This was due to me doing a comparison of the two I had been interested in using myself. This left out Hugo which I should have done as part of the comparison. Since then I have looked into Hugo and its differences and similarities to WordPress and Jekyll. The ability to run a Hugo site out of a repository in Github is one of my favorite features.

7 out of 8 - I did an okay job of looking further into the CMS that I failed to include in the CMS comparison assignment. I did however do a good job of comparing the ones that I initially compared.
# Final Grade

37 out of 40 - I did a good job of exploring things that interested me outside of class and created some key workflows for the CMS guidebook work. I did not do a perfect job but I do feel I earned the grade I have evaluated for myself here.

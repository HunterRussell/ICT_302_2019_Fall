# Week 12.2—Explore

## review application programming interfaces (15:00 to 15:05)

an application programming interface is like a translator between two different softwares—one that you have control over, and one that's developed by another company or organization

## take a peek at the WordPress API (15:05 to 15:10)

- visit the page linked to in the syllabus
- WordPress actually has several APIs
- take about five minutes to skim through the documents
  - they're likely too technical for you to follow exactly what's going on
  - that said, you should be familiar enough with WordPress at this point that you can get a broad idea of:
    - what the API allows you to
      - interact with (send, receive, etc.) or
      - modify in

## discuss WordPress API (15:10 to 15:15)

- based on what you found in the WordPress APIs, what could you:
  - interact with (send, receive, etc.)
  - modify

## introduce WordPress plugins (15:15 to 15:17)

- introduce websites in the syllabus (you can also look outside of the website—WP is popular enough that your search engine of choice should turn up "WordPress plugin to do X")

- we are going to spend about fifteen minutes just searching for and browsing plugins; the idea here is that we want to gain an appreciation for just how customizable WordPress really is

- introduce categories we're going to look for:
  - most useful (you can see why this would be really valuable!)
  - most surprising (either totally dumb or useful, but unexpected)
  - sketchiest (you're not sure you'd trust this on your website)

- when you've found a contender for one of these categories, please come up and write the name of the plugin on the board

## exploration time (15:17 to 15:32)

- give folks alerts at 5-minute intervals

## deconstruction time (15:32)

- have people report out on the plugins that they found
- everyone search for the plugin in the official search bar
